# Medical-Team-Scheduling-DSS
Optimizing medical team formation for non-emergency operations
# Decision Support System for Scheduling Medical Teams

## Objective
Develop a Decision Support System (DSS) for scheduling non-emergency medical teams, optimizing team composition for better efficiency and performance.

## Problem Statement
The hospital currently assigns teams to operations ad hoc, leading to inefficiencies. This project proposes a solution to optimize team formation using a data-driven approach.

## Approach
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Generated insights to understand the surgical team formation problem.
2. **Optimality Criteria**: Defined metrics to evaluate team efficiency based on provided data.
3. **Spreadsheet Solution**: Created an Excel-based model for team scheduling and optimization.
4. **Future Recommendations**: Suggested additional data collection and a roadmap for implementing a full-scale DSS.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains operation data used for analysis.
- `docs/`: Proposal and project documentation.
- `model/`: Excel model demonstrating the solution.

## Results
- Enhanced team efficiency by grouping personnel based on predefined criteria.
- Proposed a minimal set of data for improving the model's accuracy.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Medical-Team-Scheduling-DSS.git
